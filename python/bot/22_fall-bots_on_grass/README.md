30 min ? - random bot, won Wood
4.1. 1755 - 1815, 1822 - 1831, 2155 - 2208 (in train, underground, bus) - finished refactoring to Tiles and Vect, started recyclers
4.1. 22:55 - 0:25, 0:37 - 1:20 prefer move to adjacent, build constraints, stabilization proxy heuristics -> Silver league (most likely)!

### TODO:
- [X] save map somehow
- [X] bots - go to the nearest unoccupied - search at least 4 adjacent tiles
- [X] build 3 recyclers
- [ ] build recycler, if it will create at least 10

nice to have:
- [ ] my tile and unit numbers are a bit off do I want to dela with that now? probably not really
- [ ] not spawn where i try to build - but it is just warning
