# 22 spring bot contest - Notes, todos, data, ...

## time spent
21.4. 15:45 - 16:05 - prepare
21.4. 2210 - 2310 basic structs, attack monster nearest base, enough for Wood 1 probably?
24.4. 1505 - 1740 IDE configuring, refactor, basic exploration, still bronze
24.4. 1910 - 1950 cast WIND as last resort (if not shielded) - good defense against just spiders
24.4. 2115 - 


ideas/todos:
how fast can hero get to the monster?
defend only w/ necessary num of heroes

when I can select which monster to attack not nearest but nearest with threat_for = myself

when monster outside of my 5k radius and > 100 mana and monster.health > 20?, control to opp base (random select/switch between 2 extremes?)
if monster threat for=2, cast shield if mana > 150 and blabla?


seeds:
boss 3 has more wild mana 454 vs 118
seed=-5057810513120155600
